# Selkies Desktop

code-server extension for opening the local Selkies desktop with one click.

The extension:

- opens Selkies through the code-server same-origin `/proxy/3000/` route;
- opens a dedicated main-editor panel by default instead of Simple Browser;
- retains the panel while hidden and restores it with the workspace;
- provides reload, 50%-125% zoom, reset-to-100%, and external-open controls;
- can prefer VS Code's Integrated Browser if a future code-server host exposes it;
- writes HiDPI and UI DPI client preferences through a temporary same-origin
  bootstrap page before Selkies loads;
- adds a `Selkies` status-bar button;
- keeps the default desktop on the current code-server origin even when
  `proxy-domain` is configured, so `/proxy/3000/` reuses the existing gateway
  session instead of opening a separately authenticated port subdomain;
- leaves startup ownership to Agent Workspace Control Center by default.

No Selkies or nginx server files are modified. In automatic mode the bootstrap
HTTP listener binds to `127.0.0.1` on an ephemeral port and is reached through
the same-origin code-server path proxy. An explicitly configured absolute URL
is opened directly and does not receive this same-origin preference bootstrap.

## Commands

- `Selkies Desktop: Open`
